                  After training, the model can be used to predict whether a
                  news article is real, or fake, and if is fake to predict its
                  nuance. The model can also be used to generate a confidence
                  score for each prediction based on the features it has
                  learned. This makes it a powerful tool for verifying the
                  authenticity of news articles and other information online.

                  We didn&quot;t choose to use{" "}
                  <span className="font-bold">BERT</span> without a reason. We
                  chose it because it is a powerful model that can be used for a
                  wide range of natural language processing tasks, including
                  text classification, question answering, and named entity
                  recognition.
                  <span className="font-bold">BERT</span> is particularly
                  well-suited for this task due to its ability to understand the
                  context of words in a sentence, making it highly effective at
                  distinguishing between nuanced differences in text. We also

                  The model performed well on the test set, achieving high
                  scores in all metrics. The high scores indicate that the model
